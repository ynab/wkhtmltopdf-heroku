# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [3.1.0] - 2024-08-03

Removing built in support for pdfkit wicked_pdf and wisepdf and replacing
wkhtmltopdf binary with a fresh binary from a trusted source.

## [3.0.0] - 2024-07-12

No changes since `3.0.0.pre.rc0`. This version also works with Heroku-24 stack.

## [3.0.0.pre.rc0] - 2023-02-07

This version is the same as `2.12.6.1.pre.jammy` but with a major
version bump. Previously we've been trying to include `wkhtmltopdf`
versions in the tags, however that has proven to be difficult as
sometimes we have to make small adjustments in the gem and release a
minor-patch version. Starting from `3.0.0` we will switch to semantic
versioning: `Major.Minor.Patch`. `Major` version would denote breaking changes (platform
compatibility, etc), `Minor`version will be new features and
`wkhtmltopdf` gem upgrades, and `Patch` version will include bug fixes
and small changes limited to this gem only.
